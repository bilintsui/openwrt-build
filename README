- How to use?

1. Execute "init.sh" provided here.
2. Customize your configuration.
3. Upload the ".config" file or create a pull request (if you are not the owner).

Then the job will automatically start when push or PR merged. You can get artifacts through GitHub Action.

- Why use a forked respository instead of the original one?

Because the upstream repository is committed frequently, so I forked the respository to avoid this instability.
The forked one will be updated at random time, but not too often.

- What is "prebuild.sh"?

Just a customizable shell script will be executed between step "Update feeds" and step "Make download".

- Alternative methods to start a build job

You can directly submit the task through the Action page.
